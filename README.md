# Command Line Hangman Game
This project utilizes node.js, JavaScript object constructors and the `inquirer` npm package to build a hangman game based on the command line.

## How to Play
Simply download or clone this repository onto your computer and navigate to it on Terminal or Bash. Type in `npm install` to install the necessary npm packages and then enter `node index.js` to begin playing. The program will select a mystery word from its word bank and print the corresponding string of underscores to the command line. It will then prompt you to guess which letters are in the mystery word. If you do not successfully deduce the word before submitting nine incorrect guesses, the program will reset. To exit the game, enter `Ctrl + C`.
